# Imagej-BatchProcessing-IsothermalCrystallizationKinetics
Imagej Batch Processing Isothermal Crystallization Kinetics (IBI) is designed for batch processing in Fiji Is Just ImageJ (FIJI) software with an acquisition for isothermal crystallization kinetics analysis that can be further uploaded in R programming.
# Citation
Please note that IBI is not yet available through Fiji, and in the future will be in a publication. For now, if you use it successfully for your research please be so kind to email me how it was helpful. ðŸ˜Ž

# IBI
IBI was developed to serve as a tool for the polymer chemist & material scientist image analysis community, so that isothermal crystallization analysis can be developed more easily and quickly, and so that end-users can use them to perform their own research.
